# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:
This is our first week. We learned Scratch.

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations.

### What is visual programming?
Visual programming is a sort of programming language that allows users to illustrate processes. A visual programming language enables developers to explain the process in words that are understandable to humans, as opposed to a traditional text-based computer language that forces the developer to think like a machine. The size of the gap from visual to conventional programming is determined by the visual programming tool.
